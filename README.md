# Hi, I'm elphaim

I have a PhD in theoretical physics and am currently interested in the intersection of machine learning and scientific research.

## Projects

| Repository | Description | Stack |
|---|---|---|
| [pinn-1d](https://github.com/elphaim/pinn-1d) | Generalizing PINN benchmarks from the heat equation to other PDEs while testing the abilities of Claude Code | Python, Claude Code |
| [pinn-heat-1d](https://github.com/elphaim/pinn-heat-1d) | Benchmarking optimization techniques for Physics-Informed Neural Networks on the 1D heat equation. Compares Adam, L-BFGS and variants; includes convergence analysis. | PyTorch, NumPy |
| [multisector-pyFi](https://github.com/elphaim/multisector-pyFi) | End-to-end quantitative equity strategy engine: data ingestion, factor construction (momentum, volatility), portfolio scoring, and backtesting. Ridge regression with Optuna hyperparameter tuning. | Python, PostgreSQL, Docker, Optuna |
| [ResNet20-for-CIFAR10](https://github.com/elphaim/ResNet20-for-CIFAR10) | ResNet-20 implementation from scratch achieving 90%+ accuracy on CIFAR-10. | TensorFlow, Keras |
